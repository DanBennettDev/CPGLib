## Python Bindings for CPGLib

Coverage is not complete, but some CPGLib functionality is made available through python bindings.

This can be built as per the main project body using cmake, but requires Boost.Python and Python 3.

In the future, a proper setup.py utility must be created for ease of use.

Thanks to Thomas Kaplan for writing these bindings.
